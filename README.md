# slot-machine-using-node

This is a simple Slot Machine Project made using node.js.
It is a terminal based game.

1. User has to input a balance
2. The balance is shown at the start and after every spin.
3. User has to input the amount of lines to bet on which is 1, 2, 3.
4. User has to provide the amount to bet per line.
5. Machine spins and provides result.
6. Balance of user is updated based the results produced.

My aim for this project was to get a better understanding of how to make a program on node.js.
Thank You
